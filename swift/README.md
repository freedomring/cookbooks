Description
===========
Placeholder for the OpenStack Object Storage service `Swift` as part of the OpenStack `Essex` reference architecture using Chef. The http://github.com/opscode/openstack-chef-repo will contain documentation for using this cookbook in the context of a full OpenStack deployment.

Swift recipes will be intended for multi-node deployments but supporting a single machine install will be a special case of multi-node and managed with a role.
